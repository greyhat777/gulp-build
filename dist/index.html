  					<h1 class="header-title">SEO, WebDesign, and WebDevelopment</h1>
	  				<p>I started this website in order to showcase my skill-set for SEO, Webdesign, and WebDevelopment. I’ve been primarily working as a web developer for several years now; however, my passion lies in being able to design and build out websites that are fast, responsive, W3C Validated, 508 compliant, and fully optimized for search engines. </p>
	  				<p>What sets me apart from other designers & developers is the way in which I build out new projects from scratch. I don’t use tools like Photoshop and Sketch in order to build out mockups of what I want my final design to look like, because I feel that the hours spent during this process are instead much better spent in developing the end product using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Instead, what I like to do is to understand the requirements and wireframe the designs out on a piece of paper. If a virtual copy of the wireframe is necessary for approval, I like to use a tool like Sketch to wireframe my design ideas, or just scan the hand written wireframe notes I come up with. </p>
	  				<p>From personal experience, I have discovered that my process for designing and developing is a lot more efficient than spending hours on a tool that’s bloated and originally intended for image manipulation, not for designing webpages. I have no problem taking a PSD file from another designer and turning it into a pixel perfect webpage, but if I’m the one designing from scratch, I prefer to only do a wireframe so that I have more time in optimizing webpages. Aside from saving me hours of work, I like to do things this way, because it’s much more realistic for the end user. For example, you can’t show off the JavaScript functionality with only a PSD design. What if you wanted your webpage to do something like show a complete header image when a user visits a webpage and only show the main navigation menu when you scrolled down 50pixels with an opacity being set? Good luck trying to convey this kind of functionality with only using Photoshop. On the other hand, by simply wire framing this in the notes, and prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this is a lot simpler and more efficient. </p>
	  				<p>Saving time in the design processes allows for more time allocation in what really matters. It’s pointless to have an awesome website design if no one is looking at the webpages. This is why search engine optimization is so important. There are different techniques and strategies for SEO; however, my focus is on-page optimization, which is the practice of optimizing individual webpages in order to rank higher and earn more relevant traffic in search engines.  There are other techniques of course, but this SEO technique is what I specialize in. Typically a webpage that is optimized properly for SEO will also be error free by the W3C validator and more compliant than a webpage that is not well put together. By making sure that a webpage is coded properly the first time, you also make it a lot more accessible to users with disabilities.</p>
	  				<p>If you’re looking for someone who cares about his work, and has several years of experience under his belt in SEO, Web Design, and Web Development then give me a chance to work for you. I have excellent references, and I'm someone who works well with others.</p>
